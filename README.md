# Project Management Problem Definition: Air Monitoring System for a Patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
# Project Title:
# Design and Implementation of an Air Quality Monitoring System for Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Project Description:
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and damage to various body systems. Environmental factors, particularly air quality, can significantly exacerbate SLE symptoms. The aim of this project is to design a robust and user-friendly air monitoring system that continuously evaluates air quality parameters, providing real-time feedback to patients with SLE. This system will help patients avoid environments that could trigger flare-ups, thereby improving their health and quality of life.

Objectives:
Develop an air monitoring system capable of measuring key air quality parameters: particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), temperature, and humidity.
Ensure the system is user-friendly, portable, and reliable.
Provide real-time data visualization and alerts through a mobile application.
Integrate the system with cloud storage for long-term data analysis and tracking.
Ensure the system is cost-effective and easily maintainable.

Key Stakeholders:
Patient with SLE (primary user)
Mechatronic engineer (project lead and designer)
Healthcare providers (consultants for medical advice)
Software developers (mobile app and cloud integration)
Component suppliers (sensors and electronic parts)

Project Scope:
Requirements Analysis:
Understand specific air quality parameters affecting SLE patients.
Gather user requirements from the patient to ensure the design meets their needs.

System Design:
Select appropriate sensors for measuring air quality parameters.

Test the prototype for accuracy, reliability, and durability.
Iterate the design based on test results and feedback.

Mobile Application Development:
Design a user-friendly interface for the mobile app.
Implement real-time data visualization, alerts, and historical data analysis features.
Ensure seamless communication between the air monitoring device and the mobile app.

Cloud Integration:
Develop a cloud-based solution for data storage and long-term analysis.
Implement secure data transmission protocols.

Testing and Validation:
Conduct extensive testing in various environmental conditions.
Validate the system's accuracy and reliability against standard air quality monitors.
Collect feedback from the patient and healthcare providers.

Documentation and Training:
Create comprehensive user manuals and technical documentation.
Provide training sessions for the patient and healthcare providers.

Deployment and Support:
Deploy the final product to the patient.
Offer ongoing technical support and maintenance.

Timeline:
Requirements Analysis: 3 days
System Design: 5 days
Prototype Development: 3 days
Testing and Validation: 2 days
Documentation and Training: 1 day
Deployment and Support: Ongoing
Risk Management:
Technical Risks:

Sensor inaccuracies or failures: Mitigate by selecting high-quality sensors and conducting thorough testing.
Communication failures: Ensure robust wireless communication protocols and redundancy.
Project Risks:

Timeline delays: Maintain a detailed project schedule and conduct regular progress reviews.
User Risks:

User interface complexity: Involve the patient in the design process to ensure usability.
Expected Outcomes:
A functional and reliable air monitoring system tailored to the needs of SLE patients.
Improved health and quality of life for the patient through better environmental awareness and management.
Potential for wider application and commercialization of the system for other patients with similar needs.
